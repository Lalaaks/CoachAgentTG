A personal, owner-only Telegram coaching bot built with **aiogram (v3)** and **SQLite**.  
The bot focuses on quick daily workflows (study sessions, reminders, simple agent architecture) and is designed to be extended with multiple “agents” (study, productivity, finance, etc.).

## Features (current situation)

- **Study sessions**: start a session, complete it with a short reflection, and store it in SQLite.
- **Stats**: basic 7-day session/minute summary.
- **Agents**: enable/disable agents (MVP registry stored in SQLite).
- **Oppari agent (WIP)**: thesis workflow helper with sessions, goals, next steps, streak, and reminders.
- **Owner-only mode**: the bot responds only to a configured Telegram user ID.
